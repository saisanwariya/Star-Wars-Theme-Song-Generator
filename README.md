# Star Wars Theme Song Generator and Audio Editor

## Overview
This MATLAB script generates the iconic theme song of "Star Wars" and allows you to perform various audio editing operations on it. The script defines musical notes, their frequencies, and duration to compose the melody. You can also manipulate the playback speed, create fade-in and fade-out effects, and even play the song in reverse.

## Program Functionality
- **Music Generation**: The script defines musical notes and their corresponding frequencies to generate the "Star Wars" theme song.

- **Playback**: You can play the generated song using the `soundsc` function.

- **Speed Adjustment**: You can speed up or slow down the song by modifying the playback speed factor in the script.

- **Fade Effects**: The script includes code to create fade-in and fade-out effects at the beginning and end of the song.

- **Reverse Playback**: You can play the song in reverse by using the `fliplr` function.

## Running the Program
To run this program in MATLAB, follow these steps:

1. Open MATLAB.

2. Copy the entire script code into a new MATLAB script file or the MATLAB editor.

3. Ensure that your MATLAB environment has the necessary audio processing toolbox installed, as it is required for audio playback and writing.

4. Run the script by clicking the "Run" button in the MATLAB editor or by typing `run` followed by the script filename in the MATLAB command window.

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the program, including pressing any key to continue after playing the song or manipulating the audio effects.

## Notes
- Ensure that you have the required audio hardware set up correctly to hear the generated sound.

- Make sure to respect academic integrity when using this code or any part of it. Refer to the provided "Academic Integrity Statement" for guidelines on proper use.

- You can modify the script to customize the song or experiment with different audio effects.

- The script uses a linear fade-in and fade-out effect. You can adjust the `fade_in_time` and `fade_out_time` variables to control the duration of these effects.

- Feel free to explore and enhance the script to create your own music or audio effects.
